# NOTE: On most Linux distributions, you need to be part of the 'dialout'
# group to talk to serial devices.  If you get an error message regarding
# /dev/whatever, try: 'sudo usermod -aG dialout USERNAME', where "USERNAME" is
# you.  You'll have to logout and back in (or close/re-open a shell window)
# to pick up your new permissions.

# Edit the first few lines of the included shell script "sign" to suit your
# serial device (whether it's a serial port, ttyUSBx, etc), then try the
# following:

# Run once, show the current time:
./sign "~}qwh`date +%H:%m`"

# Loop, Slow, Show all available colors:
./sign '~zaAbBcCdDeEfFgGhHiIjJkKlLmMnNoO  '

# Set bg back to black, then play with flashing colors:
./sign '`parsbrscrsdrsers'

# Show your mail count, once.
mc=`grep "^From: " $MAIL|wc -l`
./sign "}fxqMESSAGES:^$mc"

# Loop and set red/green as colors, then display alternating colored arrows:
./sign '{bph'; ./sign '  [_  p'

# cycle all lights through all colors
sign '~rsv'
