You can use your own software, an ordinary serial terminal program or the
included "sign" shell script to send messages to the display. A message
consists of up to 255 characters, terminated with a carriage return, line
feed or both.

The display font is all uppercase.  Due to the limitations of a 6-row
display, lowercase letters are not supported.  I do make use of a-z in the
input strings however, allowing runtime color changes, delays, speed
adjustments and a few other tricks.

ASCII codes 0x60-0x7E (mostly lowercase letters) set colors or perform
special functions when they appear in a message string.  These can be
intermingled with text to display, allowing sophisticated displays with just
a little typing.

Colors:         Functions:             Special Chars:
                
` Black         p Swap FG/BG color     ^ half-space (2 pixels)
a Pink          q Fill with BG         [ Left-facing arrow
b Red           r Fill with FG         ] Right-facing arrow
c Orange        s Update strands       _ Horizonal line (extends arrows)
d Peach         t Pause 1 second
e Gold          u Pause 4 seconds
f Yellow        v Cycle foreground colors
g Lime          w Scroll as fast as possible
h Green         x Scroll fast
i Teal          y Scroll normal
j Cyan          z Scroll slow (speeds also affect "v" effect)
k Blue          | Move "cursor" to first column
l Violet        ~ Defaults (black bg, white fg, normal speed,repeat)
m Purple        } Show 1 cycle
n Magenta       { Repeat forever
o White
