You can use your own software, an ordinary serial terminal program or the
included "sign" shell script to send messages to the display. A message
consists of up to 255 characters, terminated with a carriage return, line
feed or both.

The display font is all uppercase.  Due to the limitations of a 6-row
display, lowercase letters are not supported.  I do make use of a-z in the
input strings however, allowing runtime color changes, delays, speed
adjustments and a few other tricks.

ASCII codes 0x60-0x7E (mostly lowercase letters) set colors or perform
special functions when they appear in a message string.  These can be
intermingled with text to display, allowing sophisticated displays with just
a little typing.

Colors:         Functions:             Special Chars:
                
` Black         p Swap FG/BG color     ^ half-space (2 pixels)
a Pink          q Fill with BG         [ Left-facing arrow
b Red           r Fill with FG         ] Right-facing arrow
c Orange        s Update strands       _ Horizonal line (extends arrows)
d Peach         t Pause 1 sec
e Gold          u Pause 4 sec
f Yellow        v No scroll delay
g Lime          w Normal scroll speed
h Green         x Scroll faster
i Teal          y Scroll slower
j Cyan          z Cycle FG color; update display
k Blue          | Increment FG color on each blit
l Violet        ~ Defaults (black bg, white fg, normal speed,repeat)
m Purple        } Show 1 cycle
n Magenta       { Repeat forever   
o White

EXAMPLES: 

Edit the first few lines of the included shell script "sign" to suit, then
try the following:

* Run once, show the current time:
./sign "}qwh`date +%H:%m`"

* Loop, Slow, Show all available colors:
./sign '{|aAbBcCdDeEfFgGhHiIjJkKlLmMnNoO  '

* Gold background, Green foreground, then purple foreground:
./sign 'epiGO PACKERS!      nI MEAN VIKINGS!      '

* Set bg back to black, then play with flashing colors:
./sign '`parsbrscrsdrsers'

* Show your mail count, once.
mc=`grep "^From: " $MAIL|wc -l`; ./sign "}fxqMESSAGES:^$mc"

* Loop, Fast, Flash red/green; clear screen, then say "MERRY XMAS!".
./sign '{ybrsuirsubrsuirsuqstMERRY bXMAS!      u'

* Loop, Set red/green as colors, then display alternating colored arrows:
./sign '{bpi'; sign '  [_  p'

* Set background to black, clear the screen to the background color:
./sign '`pqs'
